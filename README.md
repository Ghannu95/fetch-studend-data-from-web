# fetch-studend-data-from-web
THIS A COLLAGE PROJECT GIVEN TO ME TO FETCH THE STUDENT DATA FROM THE SOCIAL NETWORKING SITE ( USING WEB SCRAPPING). STUDENT INPUT DATA WAS PROVIDED BY MY COLLAGE.

To do this project we use selenium as scrapping tool which scrape students data from LinkedIn (we are note able to use scrapy because web scrapping is illegal according to LinkedIn and my IP address is blocked by LinkedIn when we use scrapy for scrapping).

We made a interactive GUI using Tkinter(Python) which is the large part of the project.

We use MySQL to store scrapped data in the Database(You have to use your own database). 

KINDELY USE YOUR OWN DATABASE INFORMATION. I HAVE INDICATED THE FIELDS WITH <...> SIGN.

THANK YOU.
